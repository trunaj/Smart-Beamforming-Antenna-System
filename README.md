# Smart-Beamforming-Antenna-System

Project Summary:
Designed and simulated a Smart Antenna Beamforming System using a Uniform Linear Array (ULA) to dynamically steer radiation patterns toward desired directions.
Implemented beam steering using phase shifting techniques to enhance signal strength and minimize interference in specific directions (e.g., -30째, 0째, 30째, 60째).
Simulated antenna radiation patterns using MATLAB, visualized through polar plots to compare performance with and without beamforming.
Developed modular MATLAB scripts that support:
ULA radiation pattern simulation
Beam steering at arbitrary angles
Comparison of multiple directions
Animated sweeping of the beam
Demonstrated directional gain, narrower beamwidth, and suppression of sidelobes, which are key characteristics of smart antenna arrays used in 5G and Wi-Fi communication systems.


 Technologies and Tools Used:
MATLAB: For simulation, visualization, and algorithm implementation.
Phased Array Theory: Array factor, steering vector, phase control.
Signal Processing Concepts: Beamforming, direction of arrival, angle scanning.
Polar Coordinates and Antenna Theory: For plotting radiation patterns.


Key Concepts Demonstrated:
Smart Antennas and Spatial Filtering
Beam Steering using Complex Weighting
Radiation Pattern Normalization
Array Factor Visualization
Modular Coding and Simulation Automation
